# Github Markdown Render

**Github Markdown Render** is a small utility that allows to render a given Markdown file hosted on Github.
It's been built using [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com) and [Marked](https://marked.js.org/).
I created it to display my app privacy policies, as Google recently banned those that were in PDF format.
